Changes with Apache 2.5.1

  *) mpm_event: Do lingering close in worker(s).  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mpm_queue: Put fdqueue code in common for MPMs event and worker.
     [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: adding AP_DECLARE for ap_parse_vhost_addrs() and minor bumb mmn. Resolves
     building mod_ssl on Windows. [Stefan Eissing, Gregg Smith]

  *) mod_http2: discourage gzip/brotli content encoding on http2-status responses as
     they are inserted into the reponse when filters are already done. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) core: adding defines to allow interworking with honggfuzz without
     further patches. [Stefan Eissing, Robert Swiecki]

  *) mod_headers: 'RequestHeader set|edit|edit_r Content-Type X' could 
     inadvertently modify the Content-Type _response_ header. Applies to
     Content-Type only and likely to only affect static file responses.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_cgi: Improve AH01215 messages to make it more clear that the message is
     the CGI scripts stderr output. PR 61980. [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_headers: Allow 'Header unset Content-Type' to remove the Content-Type
     header. PR 61983. [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_md v1.1.8: new configuration directive "MDBaseServer on|off" to allow/inhibit 
     management of the base server domains outside VirtualHosts. By default, this is "off", 
     e.g. mod_md will not manage certificates or perform https: redirections on the 
     base server. [Stefan Eissing]
              
  *) core: Add "AcceptErrorsNonFatal" to allow ECONNREFUSED, ECONNABORTED, and
     ECONNRESET during the client accept() to not trigger graceful shutdown of
     the child process.  [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_md v1.1.7:
     - MDMustStaple was unable to create the necessary OpenSSL OBJ identifier on some platforms, 
       possibly because this fails if the OID is already configured in ```openssl.cnf```, see
       [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/2795).
     - Two memory leaks in cert issuer and alt-names lookup eliminated by Yann Ylavic.
     - Changing MDMustStaple triggers certificate renewal.
     - More verbosity when *not* handing out certificates, e.g. mod_ssl asks, but mod_md has no
       idea what it is talking about. Some people report misbehaviour here.
     - Re-enabled support for md_get_credentials() function that was used in older mod_ssl
       patch, so that people with old patched servers get a chance to upgrade.
     [Stefan Eissing, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_susbtitute: Allow expressions in the subtitution, prefixed with expr=
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_md: fixed mem pool usage for auto-added server names. Added
     error logging of exact ACME response when challenges failed.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_dumpio: do nothing below log level TRACE7.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_md: reverses most of v1.0.5 optimization of post_config init, so that
     mod_ssl can ask for certiticates without crashing. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy: allow SSLProxyCheckPeer* usage for all proxy modules.
     PR 61857.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_html: fix handling of <meta http-equiv> elements.
     PR 58121.  [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_md: fixed backward compatibility to old <ManagedDomain configuration.
     Add higher level WARNING log when initial request to ACME server fails, mentioning
     some advice. [Stefan Eissing] 
     
  *) mod_ldap: Fix a case where a full LDAP cache would continually fail to 
     purge old entries and log AH01323. PR61891.  
     [Hendrik Harms <hendrik.harms gmail.com>]

  *) mod_md: name change in configuration directives. The old names are still working
     in this version, so you can safely upgrade. They will give warnings in the log and
     will disappear in the immediate future. ManagedDomain is now MDomain,
     <ManagedDomain> is now <MDomainSet>. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: renamed section <SSLPolicy to <SSLPolicyDefine. Fixed behaviour
     for new server config merge flag. Denying global, only once used directives
     inside a SSLPolicyDefine. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_auth_basic: Be less tolerant when parsing the credencial. Only spaces
     should be accepted after the authorization scheme. \t are also tolerated.
     [Christophe Jaillet]
  
  *) mod_http2: fixed unfair scheduling when number of active connections
     exceeded the scheduling fifo capacity. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) core: Support zone/scope in IPv6 link-local addresses in Listen and
     VirtualHost directives (requires APR 1.7.x or later).  PR 59396.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.5, restricting post_config dry run to be more silent and performing
     only necessary work for mod_ssl to be also happy with the configuration.
     [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_md: v1.0.4, removed the 'a2md' utility command from build. Only used in github
     testing. Avoid problems with our build system that had problems after the latest
     changes to make a clean initial build. Remove the windows a2md.dsp therefore also.
     [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_ssl: Fail with 403 if the username for FakeBasicAuth mode
     includes a colon character.  PR 52644.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.3, fixed various bugs in persisting job properties, so that status is 
     persisted accross child process changes and staging is reset on reloads. Changed 
     MDCertificateAgreement url checks. As long as the CA reports that the account has 
     an agreement, no further checking is done. Existing accounts need no changes when
     a new agreement comes out. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_watchdog: Correct some log messages.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) core: silently ignore a not existent file path when IncludeOptional
     is used. PR 57585. [Alberto Murillo Silva <powerbsd yahoo.com>, Luca Toscano]

  *) mod_noloris: complete build setup.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_md: fix static compilation.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_md: fix compilation of helper binary a2md.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) core: fix pcre feature detection in configure when using pcre2.  [Rainer Jung]

Changes with Apache 2.5.0-alpha

  *) mod_macro: fix usability of globally defined macros in .htaccess files.
     PR 57525.  [Jose Kahan <jose w3.org>, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.1, ServerName/Alias names from pure-http: virtual hosts are no longer
     auto-added to a Managed Domain. Error counts of jobs are presisted. When the server
     restarts (gracefully) any errored staging areas are purged to reset the signup/renewal
     process. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) htpasswd: Don't fail in -v mode if password file is unwritable.
     PR 61631.  [Joe Orton]

  *) core: A signal received while stopping could have crashed the main
     process.  PR 61558.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.0, new config directive 'MDNotifyCmd' to hook in a program when Managed
     Domains have obtained/renewed their certificates successfully. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_rewrite, core: add the Vary header when a condition evaluates to true
     and the related RewriteRule is used in a Directory context
     (triggering an internal redirect). [Luca Toscano]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.9, fix for applying challenge type based on available ports. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy_uwsgi: New UWSGI mod_proxy (sub)module contributed by unbit.com.

  *) mod_http2: v0.10.12, removed optimization for mutex handling in bucket beams that 
    could lead to assertion failure in edge cases. [Stefan Eissing] 
     
  *) mod_md: v0.9.7
     - Use of the new module flag
     - Removed obsolete function from interface to mod_ssl. 
     - Fallback certificates has version set and no longer claims to be a CA. (re issue #32)
     - MDRequireHttps now happens before any Redirect.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: unshare SSLSrvConfigRec instances between base server and virtual hosts. This avoids
     overwrites of later initializattions (vhost_id), selective disables by "SSLEngine addr-list"
     and certificate/key pickup from mod_md. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_rewrite, core: Avoid the 'Vary: Host' response header when HTTP_HOST is
     used in a condition that evaluates to true. PR 58231 [Luca Toscano, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.6: a "MDRequireHttps permament" configured domain automatically sends out
     HSTS (rfc 6797) headers in https: responses. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: adding ssl_policies.h[.in] for policy cipher/protocol definitions. Use 
     update_policies.py to update manually from Mozilla JSON definitions at
     https://statics.tls.security.mozilla.org/server-side-tls-conf.json
     [Stefan Eissing]
     
  *) mod_md: v0.9.5:
     - New directive (srly: what do you expect at this point?) "MDMustStaple on|off" to control if
       new certificates are requested with the OCSP Must Staple extension.
     - Known limitation: when the server is configured to ditch and restart child processes, for example
       after a certain number of connections/requests, the mod_md watchdog instance might migrate 
       to a new child process. Since not all its state is persisted, some messsages might appear a
       second time in the logs.
     - Adding checks when 'MDRequireHttps' is used. It is considered an error when 'MDPortMap 443:-'
       is used - which negates that a https: port exists. Also, a warning is logged if no 
       VirtualHost can be found for a Managed Domain that has port 443 (or the mapped one) in
       its address list.
     - New directive 'MDRequireHttps' for redirecting http: traffic to a Managed Domain, permanently
       or temporarily.
     - Fix for using a fallback certificate on initial signup of a Managed Domain. Requires also
       a changed mod_ssl patch (v5) to take effect.
     - compatibility with libressl
       [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.2: new directive 'MDHttpProxy' to define a proxy for outgoing connection,
     some minor bugfixes, twiddle the build system to avoid non-pic code generation.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_ssl: Adding option to set a list of addr:port specs, as used in VirtualHosts
     to enable SSLEngine for all matching hosts. Updated documentation. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.1:
     - various fixes in MDRenewWindow handling when specifying percent. Serialization changed. If 
       someone already used percent configurations, it is advised to change these to a new value,
       reload and change back to the wanted ones.
     - various fixes in handling of MDPrivateKeys when specifying 2048 bits (the default) explicitly.
     - mod_md version removed from top level md_store.json file. The store has its own format version
       to facilitate upgrades.
    [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.0:
     Certificate provisioning from Let's Encrypt (and other ACME CAs) for mod_ssl virtual hosts.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: add SSLPolicy (define/use) and SSLProxyPolicy directives plus documentation. Add
     core definitions for policies 'modern', 'intermediate' and 'old', as defined by Mozilla
     in <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS>. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: new module for managing domains across VirtualHosts with ACME protocol 
     implementation for automated certificate signup and renewal. Default CA is
     the test area of Let's Encrypt right now, so certificates root will not be valid.
     Will be switched to the real service endpoint rather soon. If you need it now,
     configure 'MDCertificateAuthority https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'.
     [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Add the support for mod_proxy's flushpackets and flushwait
     parameters. [Luca Toscano, Ruediger Pluem, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_rewrite: Add 'RewriteOptions LongURLOptimization' to free memory
     from each set of unmatched rewrite conditions.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) Allow the argument to <IfFile>, <IfDefine>, <IfSection>, <IfDirective>, 
     and <IfModule> to be quoted.  This is primarily for the benefit of
     <IfFile>. [Eric Covener]

  *) Introduce request taint checking framework to prevent privilege
     hijacking through .htaccess. [Nick Kew]

  *) Add <IfDirective> and <IfSection> directives.  [Joe Orton]

  *) When using mod_status with the Event MPM, report the number of requests
     associated with an active connection in the "ACC" field. Previously
     zero was always reported with this MPM.  PR60647. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_remoteip: Add support for PROXY protocol (code donated by Cloudzilla).
     Add ability for PROXY protocol processing to be optional to donated code.
     See also: http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt
     [Cloudzilla/roadrunner2@GitHub, Jim Jagielski, Daniel Ruggeri]

  *) mod_remoteip: When overriding the useragent address from X-Forwarded-For,
     zero out what had been initialized as the connection-level port.  PR59931.
     [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Reliably run before mod_proxy_http.
     [Eric Covener]

     [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Drop an invalid Last-Modified header value coming
     from a FCGI/CGI script instead of replacing it with Unix epoch.
     Warn the users about Last-Modified header value replacements
     and violations of the RFC.
     [Yann Ylavic, Luca Toscano, William Rowe, Jacob Champion]

  *) mod_dav: Allow other modules to become providers and add ACLs
     to the DAV response.
     [Jari Urpalainen <jari.urpalainen nokia.com>, Graham Leggett]

     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_filter: Fix AddOutputFilterByType with non-content-level filters.
     PR58856 [Micha Lenk <micha lenk.info>]

  *) mod_cache: Consider Cache-Control: s-maxage in expiration
     calculations.  [Eric Covener]

     [Graham Leggett]

  *) suexec: Filter out the HTTP_PROXY environment variable because it is
     treated as alias for http_proxy by some programs. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Don't establish or reuse a backend connection before pre-
     fetching the request body, so to minimize the delay between it is supposed
     to be alive and the first bytes sent: this is a best effort to prevent the
     backend from closing because of idle or keepalive timeout in the meantime.
     Also, handle a new "proxy-flushall" environment variable which allows to
     flush any forwarded body data immediately. PR 56541+37920. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Define and UnDefine are no longer permitted in
     directory context. Previously they would always be evaulated
     as the configuration was read without regard for the directory
     context. [Eric Covener]

  *) config: For directives that do not expect any arguments, enforce
     that none are specified in the configuration file.

     [Daniel Gruno]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Resolve crashes with LDAP authz and non-LDAP authn since 
     r1608202. [Eric Covener]

  *) apreq: Content-Length header should be always interpreted as a decimal.

  *) Add the ldap-search option to mod_authnz_ldap, allowing authorization
     to be based on arbitrary expressions that do not include the username.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap function to the expression API, allowing LDAP filters and
     distinguished names based on expressions to be escaped correctly to
     guard against LDAP injection. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add module mod_ssl_ct, which provides an implementation of Certificate
     Transparency (RFC 6962) for httpd.  [Jeff Trawick]
